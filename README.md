==================

I'll put there my answers to the Project Euler problems (see http://projecteuler.net/).

Despite the fact that these scripts are for a "one shot purpose", I'll try to write nice JavaScript code.

The algorithms I'm writing may not be interesting (in terms of complexity) since I'm not that good in maths, and the problems of Project Euler are mathematical.

Despite that fact, the code might be interesting since it shows concrete uses of JavaScript native functions such as Array.reduce() or Array.some(), which are not well known to beginners.
